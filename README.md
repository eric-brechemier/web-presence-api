A Web Page as a Place
=====================

This proposal describes the Web Presence API
to display the presence of users in a Web page.

## MOTIVATION ##

While the Web 2.0 was perceived as a move from Web documents
to Web applications, bringing instant interactions to Web pages,
and the era of Social Networks developed the feeling of belonging
to a community with instant communication tools, it is still hard
to picture a Web page as a live experience shared with the other
visitors present in the page at the same time.

This proposal aims to make it easier for users to meet other visitors
of the same Web pages and to navigate together from page to page.
